Description: VAST is an R package for conducting spatio-temporal analysis
    of data from multiple categories (species, sizes, etc.), and includes both
    spatial and spatio-temporal variation in density for each category, with either
    factor-analysis or autoregressive correlations among categories, with derived
    calculation of abundance indices, center-of-gravity, and area-occupied.

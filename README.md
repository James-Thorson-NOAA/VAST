Description
=============

VAST
* Is an R package for implementing a spatial delta-generalized linear mixed model (delta-GLMM) for multiple categories (species, size, or age classes) when standardizing survey or fishery-dependent data.
* Builds upon a previous R package `SpatialDeltaGLMM` (public available [here](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM)), and has unit-testing to automatically confirm that `VAST` and `SpatialDeltaGLMM` give identical results (to the 3rd decimal place for parameter estimates) for several varied real-world case-study examples
* Has built in diagnostic functions and model-comparison tools
* Is intended to improve analysis speed, replicability, peer-review, and interpretation of index standardization methods

Background
* This tool is designed to estimate spatial variation in density using spatially referenced data, with the goal of habitat associations (correlations among species and with habitat) and estimating total abundance for a target species in one or more years.
* The model builds upon spatio-temporal delta-generalized linear mixed modelling techniques (Thorson Shelton Ward Skaug 2015 ICESJMS), which separately models the proportion of tows that catch at least one individual ("encounter probability") and catch rates for tows with at least one individual ("positive catch rates").
* Submodels for encounter probability and positive catch rates by default incorporate variation in density among years (as a fixed effect), and can incorporate variation among sampling vessels (as a random effect, Thorson and Ward 2014) which may be correlated among categories (Thorson Fonner Haltuch Ono Winker In press).
* Spatial and spatiotemporal variation are approximated as Gaussian Markov random fields (Thorson Skaug Kristensen Shelton Ward Harms Banante 2014 Ecology), which imply that correlations in spatial variation decay as a function of distance.

User resources for learning about VAST
=============
There are eleven main resources for learning about VAST:

*  *Model structure*:  Please see the [User Manual](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/blob/master/manual/VAST_model_structure.pdf) for a document listing model equations and relating them to the input/output used in R.
*  *Change documentation*:  Please see [NEWS](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/blob/master/manual/NEWS.pdf) for a document listing major changes in each numbered release; this is useful to track development changes (interface improvements, bug fixes, issues regarding dependencies, etc.) over time.

Installation Instructions
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/James-Thorson/VAST.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/James-Thorson/VAST)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/55002718.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/55002718.svg)

This function depends on R version >=3.1.1 and a variety of other tools.

First, install the "devtools" package from CRAN

    # Install and load devtools package
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")

Next, please install the VAST package from this GitHub repository using a function in the "devtools" package.  This may require using the `INSTALL_opts` option depending upon your version of R:

    # Install package
    install_github("james-thorson/VAST", INSTALL_opts="--no-staged-install")
    # Load package
    library(VAST)

If you are having problems with installation, please consider installing dependencies individually, e.g. using:

    # Install TMB from CRAN
    install.packages("TMB")
    # Install INLA using currently recommended method
    install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
    # Install FishStatsUtils from CRAN
    install_github("james-thorson/FishStatsUtils", INSTALL_opts="--no-staged-install")

Finally, please confirm that VAST is installed by running a model, e.g., following the simple example [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/wiki/Simple-example).


Known installation/usage issues
=============

1.  If using a NOAA laptop, sometimes the PATH for Rtools is not correctly specified during installation. In those cases, please follow instructions [here](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/issues/50)

2.  Some versions of R are having problems downloading dependencies from GitHub, see details [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils/issues/21)

3.  People using R version 3.6.0 or MRAN 3.5.3 are having a problem with changing standards for package namespaces, see details [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/issues/189), which appears to be particularly a problem with loading INLA due to install issues with that package.

4.  MacOS users have specific install issues and a discussion of potential fixes is [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/issues/218#issuecomment-587105809)

5.  Windows has a speed-limit on the rate that users can access the GitHub API. You can get around this by installing each package locally from a ZIP file.  You'll need to first download a ZIP file for GitHub repositories `TMBhelper` ([here](https://github.com/kaskr/TMB_contrib_R/tree/master/TMBhelper)), then `ThorsonUtilities` ([here](https://github.com/James-Thorson/utilities)), then `FishStatsUtils` ([here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils)), then `VAST` ([here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST)) to your harddrive in a local directory while recording the directory name (which I will reference as `download_dir`), and then install these packages from each ZIP file in the same order. To install each package, please click "clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" -> `devtools::install_local(path=download_dir, dependencies=FALSE)`

  \item{\code{X1config_cp[c,p]=-1}}{\code{X1config_cp[c,p]=-1} is the same as \code{X1config_cp[c,p]=2}, but without including the log-likelihood term; this is useful in special cases when carefully mirroring spatially varying coefficients, e.g., to use cohort effects in a age-structured spatio-temporal model}
}}

\item{X2config_cp}{Same as argument \code{X1config_cp} but for 2nd linear predictor}

specified in \code{X1_formula} or \code{X2_formula} with specification according to \code{\link{stats::contrasts}}.

where density is weighted by the expanded value for another category ("abundance weighted expansion" \code{Expansion[c1,1]=1}),
or the index is calculated as the weighted average of density weighted by the expanded value for another category
("abundance weighted-average expansion" \code{Expansion[c1,1]=2}).  The 2nd column is only used when \code{Expansion[c1,1]=1} or \code{Expansion[c1,1]=2},

individually instead of as a single object}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{make_data}, containing inputs to function \code{\link{make_model}}
}
\description{
\code{make_data} builds a tagged list of data inputs used by TMB for running the model
}
\details{
Specification of \code{FieldConfig} can be seen by calling \code{\link[FishStatsUtils]{make_settings}},
  which is the recommended way of generating this input for beginning users.

Argument \code{FieldConfig} is a matrix of form
  \code{FieldConfig = matrix( c(0,10,"IID","Identity", "AR1",10,"IID","Identity"), ncol=2, nrow=4, dimnames=list(c("Omega","Epsilon","Beta","Epsilon_year"),c("Component_1","Component_2"))}.
  However, for backwards compatibility, \code{FieldConfig} can instead be specified as
  a vector of format \code{FieldConfig = c("Omega1"=0, "Epsilon1"=10, "Omega2"="AR1", "Epsilon2"=10)},
  which generates the same settings as the matrix specification, given the values of each shown in this example.

Both vector (simplified) and matrix (full) specification of \code{FieldConfig} involve named elements
  using the following naming conventions:
\describe{
   \item{Omega}{specifies whether spatial variation is present and/or correlated among variables}
   \item{Epsilon}{specifies whether spatio-temporal variation is present and/or correlated among variables}
   \item{Beta}{specifies whether temporal variation (a.k.a. "intercepts") is present and/or correlated among variables}
   \item{Epsilon_year}{specifies whether spatio-temporal variation is correlated among years}
}
Meanwhile, \code{Component_1} (or the numeral "1" after a component name) refers to the 1st lienar predictor (e.g., of a delta-model),
  while \code{Component_2} (or the numeral "2" after a component name) refers to the 2nd linear predictor.
  The simplified vector-specification does not include slots for \code{Beta} or \code{Epsilon_year} and therefore
  is not as general.

In each slot of \code{FieldConfig}, the user can specify various options:
\describe{
  \item{0}{turns off a given model component}
  \item{integer greater than zero}{specifies the rank (number of factors) in a factor-analysis covariance matrix}
  \item{"AR1"}{specifies that a model component is correlated following an first-order autoregressive process}
  \item{"IID"}{specifies that a given model component is a random effect that is independent for every level}
  \item{"Identity"}{specifies that a given model component has covariance of an identity-matrix;
    this is only useful for \code{Epsilon_year} to "turn off" covariance among years while still including spatio-temporal variation}
}

\code{make_data} generates arrays of covariates \code{X_gtp} and \code{X_itp} using \code{\link[FishStatsUtils]{make_covariates}};
see that function for more details.

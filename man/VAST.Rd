\title{Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal Model}
\description{
Analyze spatial variatoin in multiple variables representing data species, ages, size-classes, etc.
This can be used to implement many types of analysis including:
\itemize{
\item species distribution models with residual spatial and spatio-temporal variation, as well as covariates affecting density and catchability
\item joint species distribution models (both static and dynamic)
\item empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis,
\item vector autoregressive modelling,
\item spatial factor analysis,
\item standardization and biomass-expansion of spatially unbalanced samples
}
Features are built to be compatible among model types, e.g., by allowing catchability and density covariates to be included in EOF analysis.

See \code{\link[FishStatsUtils]{fit_model}} for a simple example of high-level wrapper functions for using VAST.
Also see the wiki \url{https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/wiki} for examples documenting many different use-cases and features.

#' Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal Model
#'
#' Analyze spatial variatoin in multiple variables representing data species, ages, size-classes, etc.
#' This can be used to implement many types of analysis including:
#' \itemize{
#' \item species distribution models with residual spatial and spatio-temporal variation, as well as covariates affecting density and catchability
#' \item joint species distribution models (both static and dynamic)
#' \item empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis,
#' \item vector autoregressive modelling,
#' \item spatial factor analysis,
#' \item standardization and biomass-expansion of spatially unbalanced samples
#' }
#' Features are built to be compatible among model types, e.g., by allowing catchability and density covariates to be included in EOF analysis.

#' See \code{\link[FishStatsUtils]{fit_model}} for a simple example of high-level wrapper functions for using VAST.
#' Also see the wiki \url{https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/wiki} for examples documenting many different use-cases and features.
